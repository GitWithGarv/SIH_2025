# 🌍 360° View Testing Guide

## ✅ Issue Fixed!

The 360° view functionality has been simplified and should now work properly. Here's how to test it:

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. **Start Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. **Navigate to Map Page**
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/map` (or the port shown in terminal)

### 3. **Test 360° View Button**

#### 📍 **Method 1: Click Tourist Spot Markers**
1. Click on any **blue marker** on the map (these are tourist spots)
2. In the popup that appears, look for the **🌐 360° View** button
3. Click the button - the modal should open

#### 📍 **Method 2: Use Sidebar**
1. On the right sidebar, click any destination from the "Popular Destinations" list
2. Look for details in the selected spot panel
3. The popup should show the 360° View button

### 4. **Test Specific Locations**

#### 🌊 **Dassam Falls** (Has panoramic image)
- Should load a mountain/desert panoramic view
- Image URL: `https://pannellum.org/images/cerro-toco-0.jpg`

#### 🏔️ **Netarhat Hill Station** (Has panoramic image)  
- Should load an architectural panoramic view
- Image URL: `https://pannellum.org/images/alma.jpg`

#### 🏙️ **Other Locations** (No panoramic image)
- Should show "360° View Coming Soon" placeholder
- Will display location name and helpful message

## 🎯 What You Should See

### ✅ **If Working Correctly:**
1. **Modal Opens** - Full-screen overlay with blue gradient header
2. **Loading State** - Shows "Loading 360° View..." with spinner
3. **Content Loads** - Either panoramic viewer or placeholder message
4. **Controls Work** - Close button (X) should close the modal

### ❌ **If Not Working:**
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
- Make sure you're clicking the 🌐 360° View button specifically
- Try refreshing the page and testing again

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Modal Doesn't Open**
- Check if you see any JavaScript errors in console
- Make sure you're clicking on a marker popup, not just the marker itself
- Try different tourist spots

### **Shows Loading Forever**
- This is normal for locations without panoramic images
- Wait 1 second, it should show the placeholder

### **Panoramic Image Doesn't Load**
- Check your internet connection
- The CDN images from pannellum.org should load automatically
- Check browser console for network errors

## 🚀 Expected Behavior

### **Locations WITH Panoramic Images:**
- **Dassam Falls**: Shows desert/mountain 360° view
- **Netarhat Hill Station**: Shows architectural 360° view
- **Controls**: Drag to look around, scroll to zoom
- **Auto-rotate**: Should rotate slowly automatically

### **Locations WITHOUT Panoramic Images:**
- Shows blue placeholder with mountain icon 🏞️
- Displays "360° View Coming Soon" message
- Shows location name at bottom

## 📝 Development Notes

The 360° view now uses:
- **CDN-based Pannellum** (loads from cdn.pannellum.org)
- **Simplified loading** (no complex Street View integration yet)
- **Better error handling** (graceful fallbacks)
- **Responsive design** (works on mobile and desktop)

## 🎉 Success Indicators

If working properly, you should be able to:
- ✅ Open the modal by clicking 360° View buttons
- ✅ See panoramic images for Dassam Falls and Netarhat
- ✅ See placeholders for locations without images
- ✅ Close the modal using the X button
- ✅ Interact with panoramic views (drag/zoom)
