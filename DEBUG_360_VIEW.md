# 🔧 Debug 360° View - Step by Step

## ✅ What I Added for Testing

I've added debugging features to help us identify the issue:

### 1. **Test Button Added**
- In the search box (top-right corner)
- Orange button labeled **"Test 360°"** 
- This bypasses the popup buttons and directly calls the modal

### 2. **Debug Console Logs**
- All 360° View buttons now log to console when clicked
- Will show either success or "360 View function not found"

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### **Step 1: Test the Direct Button**
1. Start your server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/map` page
3. Look at **top-right search box**
4. Click the **orange "Test 360°" button**
5. **Expected**: Modal should open immediately

### **Step 2: Test Popup Buttons**
1. Click any **blue marker** on the map
2. In the popup, click **🌐 360° View** button
3. **Check browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
4. **Expected**: Should see "360 View clicked for [location-id]"

### **Step 3: Check Console for Errors**
Open browser console (F12) and look for:
- ✅ "Test 360 View button clicked" (when clicking orange button)
- ✅ "360 View clicked for dassam-falls" (when clicking popup button)
- ❌ "360 View function not found" (indicates missing global function)
- ❌ Any red error messages

## 🎯 What Should Happen

### **If Orange Button Works:**
- Modal opens with blue header "Test Dassam Falls"
- Shows loading spinner, then panoramic image
- This means the modal component is working

### **If Orange Button Doesn't Work:**
- Check console for errors
- Modal component has an issue

### **If Popup Buttons Don't Work:**
- Look for "360 View function not found" alert
- Global function isn't being registered properly

## 🚨 Debugging Information

When you test, please share:

1. **Does the orange "Test 360°" button work?** (Yes/No)
2. **Do you see console messages when clicking popup buttons?** (Yes/No)
3. **Any error messages in console?** (Copy and paste them)
4. **Does any modal appear at all?** (Yes/No)

This will help me pinpoint exactly where the issue is!

## 🔍 Quick Fixes to Try

### **If Nothing Happens:**
1. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Clear browser cache** 
3. **Try in incognito/private window**

### **If Console Shows Errors:**
1. Check for JavaScript errors preventing code execution
2. Look for missing dependencies or imports
