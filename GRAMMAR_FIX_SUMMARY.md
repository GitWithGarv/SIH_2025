# üîß Speech Recognition Fix - Grammar Property Error

## ‚úÖ **Problem Identified and Solved!**

### **The Error:**
```
Speech recognition error: TypeError: Failed to set the 'grammars' property on 'SpeechRecognition': Failed to convert value to 'SpeechGrammarList'.
```

### **Root Cause:**
The `grammars` property on the SpeechRecognition API is deprecated in modern browsers and setting it to `null` causes a TypeError.

### **The Fix:**
```typescript
// Before (CAUSING ERROR):
if ('grammars' in recognition) {
  recognition.grammars = null; // ‚ùå This caused the TypeError
}

// After (FIXED):
// Note: grammars property is deprecated and causes errors in modern browsers
// Removed this code entirely
```

### **What Was Changed:**
1. **Removed the problematic grammars property assignment**
2. **Removed the deprecated serviceURI check** 
3. **Added comments explaining why these were removed**

### **Files Modified:**
- `hooks/useSpeechRecognition.ts` (lines 122-132)

## üöÄ **Test the Fix:**

Now the speech recognition should work without any errors!

### **Test Steps:**
1. **Restart your development server** (the fix is now applied)
2. **Navigate to:** `http://localhost:3001/voice-translator-demo`
3. **Click the microphone button**
4. **Speak into your microphone**
5. **Verify:** No more TypeError in console, speech recognition works!

### **Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ No console errors
- ‚úÖ Microphone button works 
- ‚úÖ Speech gets transcribed
- ‚úÖ Auto-restart works if recognition stops
- ‚úÖ Translation works (if using translator demo)

The TypeError was preventing the speech recognition from starting properly. With this fix, everything should work smoothly now!
